          Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as 
          opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a 
                    piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
                    the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
                    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"

                    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on 
                    the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
